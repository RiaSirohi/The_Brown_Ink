      <p class="w3-opacity w3-center"><i>Unpopular, Repulsive and Our Ignorance</i></p><br>

      <p>Let us begin with an honest question: why does the idea of educating women on self-defence overwhelm
        us? What is this resistance that causes us to go against this idea when we first hear it? Naturally, the next
        question would be what propels us to react so restrictively about this concept? The truth is, this concept
        was never ours to begin with, thus causing the natural repulsion that a human generates on interacting
        with a foreign concept. Therefore let us familiarise with these concepts before we pass any judgment. We
        should respond not react.</p>
      <br>

        <h3>Understanding origin.</h3>

        <p>Shani D'Cruze has penned down the reasons that contributed to the rape culture during the
            industrialisation period. Shani published it in a book named as 'Women's History Review'. She reveals the
            culture and beliefs of that time. Men were designated to be the provider and protector of women. A
            deep-rooted belief that many people tend to resonate with even today without questioning it. When
            industrialisation boomed, it led to a class system which gave birth to a sector in society who now can earn
            and pay for themselves. Getting the power and opportunity to make decisions on small things like buy
            commodities or big things like what job to do, men got the opportunity and freedom to make their own
            choices and live life on their terms. This cultural change impacted sexuality in ways that men's identity
            soon changed to the ‘chivalrous’ beings and granted them clean chit for open expression for their
            sexuality. Contrastingly women were not given any opportunity for a job in the industrialisation period,
            making initial phases of industrialisation dominated mainly by men for most parts of the society. This
            ended up adding only more to the pre-existent difference between both genders.</p>
      
        <p>As time progressed this misplaced 'chivalry' took a taxing form. Women faced sexual harassment at a
                massive level during industrialisation to such an extent that name-calling, on-street harassments became a
                usual thing. Thus in the late 19th century and early 20th century, women started protesting and gave rise
                to feminism ( which talks of equality of both genders) and corporeal feminism. Corporeal feminism tends
                to minimise the difference between the genders namely, men and women; based on body or physical
                attributes. Corporeal feminism challenges the inherent mindset that men are superior physically. Whether
                it is true or not for men being physically stronger, the corporeal feminism does not focus on that. It
                focuses on shifting the mindset. The world around us has changed and, no longer a person’s excellence is
                measured by their physical strength but rather by academics or career or monetary possessions. It is time
                that we upgrade our mindset and align it according to the current reality. While our surroundings
                developed and time progressed, our out-dated beliefs remained trapped mismatched with present reality.
                Corporeal feminism came into existence to help us make a perspective shift and gave birth to self-defence
                education.</p>
            <br>

        <h3>How can a simple perspective shift change the whole game? The Butterfly Effect.</h3>

        <h4>Formation of perceptions.</h4>

        <p>Men are the provider and protector of women. We must understand that this is just a belief that we as a
            community have absorbed and harboured, whether it’s true or not is part of another discussion. It is quite
            similar to branding. For example, Imagine the hospitality industry. Now notice how we all believe that
            Taj is the best brand in the industry. Whether Taj is actually the best or second-best or maybe worst brand
            that’s another context. But we still have an underlying agreement to ‘Taj’ being among the best brands of
            hospitality.</p>
        <p>This is how perceptions are formed in society, unchecked and uncontrolled.</p>
    <br>

        <h3>The common perception.</h3>

        <p>One of the common beliefs out of many left unchecked is that men are physically stronger than women.
            Whether it's true or not, the truth is that this belief isn't required and is outdated. As the world around us
            has changed and no longer a person’s excellence is measured by their physical strength but rather by
            academics or career or monetary possessions, there is no need for a belief that favours physical supremacy
            of any gender. It is time that we upgrade our mindset and we align it more congruent with the current
            reality. Our surrounding and time progressed, but our mindset remained trapped in the cage of
            mismatched belief.</p>
        <br>
        <h3>The toxic effect due to the superiority of one gender based on physical strength:</h3>

        <p>The moment one gender is put on a pedestal due to any excuse, the other automatically comes under the
            fragile possibility of oppression. One's superiority over the other generates a gap and society starts to feed
            off this gap. Slowly society starts to wrap the so-called better one in the aura of superiority. This
            superiority complex very easily converts into an expression of power and authority. Thus, tipping up the
            scale of the balance and birthing a new toxic belief.</p>
        <p>Believing that men are stronger, we send a subtle signal that women are meek. Thus, developing a
            common belief that hurting a woman is natural. It also fuels the belief that if a woman is bashed, wrecked,
            irritated or assaulted then no harm will be done to them. Making society's belief stronger that 'chalta hai'.
            The gap of one being better than the other instigates a hidden message that 'the better' can do away with
            their ways. This authority generated due to the boasting of one party than the other end us becoming a
            means of abuse. Thus, the protectors soon became predators.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>How can change be brought?</h3>
        <p>If an inflated perception is the root of it then, it can also be the solution to it. The gap was generated only
            because one was perceived to be better than the other. We can neutralise and bring the balance back with
            a simple change of mindset. That’s what Corporeal feminism tried to do through educating women about
            self-defence. Normalising self-defence education for the women sector holds the power to shift the
            perception of society as a large. It does serve the purpose of teaching them techniques to protect
            themselves but more importantly, it highlights the physical strength of women to the society. An
            implementation of simple action of self-defence education is capable of bringing peaceful revolution.
            Thus, bringing into action the classic butterfly effect.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>How is Self-Defence Education more than a means of protection?</h3>

        <p>Stated in a research paper by Jocelyn A. Hollander with the title 'Why Do Women Take Self-Defense
            Classes?' it is clear that the sexual assault victims were the last to enrol in self-defence classes. It shows
            that the driving factor for a woman to take part in self-defence education is different. Most women sign up
            for self-defence class because of their friend's recommendation, to become 'better versions' in some sense
            or fear of violence. Self-Defence education in no fashion promotes aggression of violence in women.
            According to the research paper written by Leanne R.Brecklin with the title 'Evaluation outcomes of
            self-defence training for women: A review', self-defence training includes physical, psychological and
            behavioural aspects. Self-defence education helped women with their assertiveness, self-esteem, anxiety,
            perceived control, fear of sexual assault and self-efficacy. It also helped women with behavioural
            outcomes, such as physical competence and avoidance behaviour. Self-defence education has made
            women more confident and holistically balanced in their emotional management. It has also proven
            beneficial to provide physiological assertiveness.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Connecting Dots.</h3>

        <p>After understanding the history of industrialisation and harassment culture, we can better understand the
            appropriate need for corporeal feminism. The kind of impact simple classes of self-defence education
            running in your residential area is, without a doubt, fundamental. Benefits that women can have on an
            individual level are substantial too. But to limit self-defence education till a person's level only will lose
            all its essence. Self-defence has to become a mass acceptance only then its power of bringing rational
            change can be realised. Therefore, bringing this blog to a close with #girlkarate.</p>
